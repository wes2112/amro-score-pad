To run the game:

This is still under construction.

Notes:	I might create a reset button that can be accessed at any time.
	In a more glorified version of this game, I'll use balls instead
	of just numbers.
	You can just hit start game without names if so chosen. They'll
	just have to remember who is on what side.
