To run the game:
1	Open folder "which you already did cause you found this"
2	Look for index.html file. Double click or drag to browser.
3	Flip coin feature if needed.
4	Winner of the coin toss. Put that name in the first field.
	Put the opponent name in the second field.
5	Press "start game". This will carry the names over to the game
	page.
6	The game will end when a player reaches 120 points.

Notes:	I might create a reset button that can be accessed at any time.
	In a more glorified version of this game, I'll use balls instead
	of just numbers.
	You can just hit start game without names if so chosen. They'll
	just have to remember who is on what side.
